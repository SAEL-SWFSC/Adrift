    "text": "Below we present a summary of our results and a summary of recommendations for future work.\n\nDrifting acoustic recorders can provide high quality PAM for some offshore regions, especially when deployed in clusters to enhance spatial monitoring.\nPilot studies are recommended for new regions, to ensure that environmental conditions and local resources support effective sampling.\nHardware continues to evolve to allow for improved data collection, and newly developed sub-surface drifting recorders may prove preferable to existing drifting recorders with surface buoys.\nOur experience suggests that deployment of clustered drifting recorders seasonally in areas of interest could provide additional spatial context to co-located seafloor recorders.\nSeasonal sampling of these clustered deployments during collaborative cruises, such as our Morro Bay fieldwork, promotes collaborative science and reduces vessel costs.\n\nThis dataset provides additional (publicly available) data to support management needs as well as new information on several species. Data analysis included most cetacean species found within the California Current; though several rare species (north Pacific right whales, pilot whales) were not included, nor were pinnipeds. The data are publicly available for future expansion of analysis to include these species.\n\nSperm whales are listed as endangered and their consistent, stereotyped vocalizations make them ideal candidates for PAM. Sperm whales were detected in all study areas, with high detection probabilities in Humboldt during all seasons. PAM data can also be used to determine the demographic composition of sperm whales, and a pilot study of a Morro Bay dataset found that all animals were social groups consisting of females and their young, or juvenile males. There was insufficient time to complete this analysis for our entire archived data, but future research should include acoustic estimations of demographic composition for sperm whales.\nBeaked whales are difficult to detect, and even harder to classify to species, based on traditional visual observation methods. As with sperm whales, beaked whales are ideal candidates for PAM, and most species can be acoustically classified to species. As an example, there were no detections of beaked whales in 30 years of ACCESS surveys; however, during our limited Adrift deployments, there were numerous detections of both Baird’s beaked whales and goose-beaked whales. Beaked whales were found in all regions, with goose-beaked whales the most common species overall (though none of these species were detected in either Humboldt or Oregon). During the Adrift study, methods to estimate beaked whale density using drifting recorders were automated (to improve efficiency), and data were prepared for analysis, but we were unable to complete this analysis during the time available.\nMany of the beaked whales detected in Morro Bay co-occurred with echolocating dolphins. The vertical hydrophone array of the drifting recorders allows for estimation of bearing angles for incoming echolocation clicks, and subsequent differentiation between echolocating beaked whales at depth from echolocating dolphins near the surface. By segregating the echolocation clicks based on bearing angle, we were able to identify the small numbers of beaked whale clicks within thousands (or even millions) of echolocating dolphins. The co-occurrence of dolphins and beaked whales has not been previously reported, and it is unclear what may bring these species together. The likelihood of detecting beaked whales in these mixed species encounters would have been very low if recordings were collected from a single, seafloor sensor or from towed hydrophone arrays.\nThe California Current has a high diversity of dolphin species, and species classification is difficult. While there are several potential approaches to species classification, they have either been developed for towed arrays at the surface (Rankin et al. 2017) or for seafloor hydrophones (Frasier et al. 2017). Currently, there is insufficient validated data for drifting recorders to test the efficacy of existing classifiers on these data, or to develop a drifting-recorder specific classifier. That said, there are robust methods to identify echolocation clicks from Pacific white-sided dolphins and Risso’s dolphins. Dolphin schools in central and northern California are frequently encountered in large, dispersed mixed species groups, and here we do not distinguish mixed species from single-species groups.\nRisso’s dolphins were detected in all regions except Oregon, and had the highest probability of detection during the upwelling season in Humboldt. The dominant click type detected was the ‘Pelagic Pacific’ type identified by Soldevilla 2017.\nPacific white-sided dolphins were detected in all regions, with higher detection probabilities in the post-upwelling season for Humboldt and San Francisco, and during the upwelling season in Morro Bay. The dominant click type for Pacific white-sided dolphins was ‘Type A’, though ‘Type B’ click types were detected northward of the range identified in Soldevilla 2010. There were relatively few detections of ‘Unidentified odontocetes’ during the post-upwelling season in Oregon and Morro Bay.\nThe California Current is home to four different species that produce NBHF echolocation clicks: harbor porpoise, Dall’s porpoise, pygmy sperm whales, and dwarf sperm whales. Despite the similarities in their echolocation clicks, these species inhabit different habitats and have different behaviors and life histories. Student work to develop a NBHF classifier for this study (see Appendix F) will be further developed in the near future and applied to these data to expand our understanding of the distribution of these species in the California Current as well as the regional WEAs.\nBlue whales were detected in all regions except Oregon, and the probability of detecting blue whales was higher during the post-upwelling season. Blue whale acoustic detections were dominated by the A/B song call types produced by males. Foraging associated ‘D’ calls were primarily detected during the post-upwelling season, and at much lower detection probabilities than A/B call types. Blue whale calls, especially the ‘B’ call type, can be detected at great ranges and the range of potential sound source locations can be large. Preliminary methods to localize low frequency sounds on clustered drifting recorders shows promise (see Appendix H), and adoption of these methods may improve our understanding of the habitat use of these species in the greater area.\nFin whales were detected throughout the study area at different times of year. Fin whale 20 Hz pulses had a higher detection probability during the post-upwelling season for all regions. Here we did not differentiate between irregular and stereotyped patterns of 20 Hz calls. The 40 Hz call associated with foraging were detected off Oregon and during the post-upwelling season off Morro Bay. These data were used to improve and test a fin whale classifier with excellent results (Appendix G), and future adoption of these methods may allow for an improved approach of classifying variability in fin whale call patterns.\nHumpback whales were detected during most deployments, though detection off Oregon was relatively low. The probability of detecting humpbacks was higher for the upwelling season for Morro Bay, while the probability of detecting humpbacks was lower during the upwelling season for both San Francisco and Humboldt. While there were few detections of humpback whales during the late June/early July surveys off Morro Bay, these animals were frequently sighted nearshore, highlighting the variability of their distribution within these greater regions.\nHumpback whales are notoriously difficult PAM subjects due to their very active vocal behavior (in quantity and variability). Many recordings can be dominated by humpback song, and this song may be the result of a single individual. There is significant research on many of the non-song vocalizations, but detection and classification of these sounds require expertise and manual classification. There are significant numbers of annotated datasets, and development of a machine learning method to detect and classify these sounds would allow researchers to better understand how the detection of humpback sounds can inform the demographic composition and habitat use of these species throughout the California Current.\nBryde’s whales occur in the tropical and sub-tropical Pacific Ocean, with occasional incursions into the Southern California Bight. We did not detect sounds associated with Bryde’s whales in this analysis, but we do expect these species may become more common with global ocean warming.\nLittle is known of the vocal repertoire of sei whales, and our research only found one potential sei whale acoustic detection. Future research should take advantage of opportunities to understand the vocal repertoire of sei whales in the North Pacific Ocean.\nMost gray whales use more shallow, coastal waters for their migration between their feeding grounds in the north and their winter breeding grounds in Baja California. Gray whales were detected off Oregon, where there is a resident population, and during the post-upwelling season in the San Francisco and Morro Bay areas. There is a significant overlap in spectral content for humpback and gray whale calls and care should be taken when inferring gray whale presence from data with concurrent humpback whale presence.\nThere were no detections of minke whale ‘boings’ during our Adrift study, and only a few during the combined PASCAL/CCES surveys. There was one visual sighting of a minke whale in coastal waters near Morro Bay harbor in November 2023; however, there were no recordings during our offshore drifts during this same survey. The lack of detections could be related to low seasonal population densities or that calling animals use coastal waters.\nIn addition to detecting marine mammal species, we manually detected ship tracks in these data (existing ship noise detectors were not reliable on our data). The percent of recording hours with vessel presence varied across region, season, and time of day, and vessel presence was generally higher in Oregon and Humboldt than in San Francisco or Morro Bay. Vessel presence in Humboldt shifted from night-time during the upwelling season to daytime during the post-upwelling season (summer), with winter variability likely relating to low effort. Morro Bay region experienced the lowest amount of vessel traffic, with extremely low levels of vessel traffic (&lt;20%) detected in the post-upwelling season. The relatively low detection of ships off San Francisco may be related to masking of individual ship passages due to the overall higher sound levels in this region. Development of a standardized approach to detecting vessels that works across platforms and compensates for elevated ambient noise due to high vessel track is warranted.\n\nThese biological and anthropogenic sounds contribute to the overall soundscape, and measurement of sound levels allows us to examine variation in the soundscape over time. Soundscape metrics aligned with previously analyzed SanctSound data for consistency, but preferred methods recommend reporting sound levels in hybrid millidecade bands. Our soundscape data will be publicly accessible to allow for this conversion. Our results show variability in sound levels over time and space, with general noise levels ranging from 50 dB re 1uPa to nearly 150 dB re 1 uPa (and the highest density of sound in the 75 – 100 dB range).\nThe marine soundscape includes sounds associated with physical drivers (rain, waves, earthquakes), biological sources (sounds produced by marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates), as well as anthropogenic sounds. In this study we examined sounds attributed to a number of marine mammal species as well as ship noise. We also developed automated methods to integrate these data to better understand these various contributors to the soundscape, and how they change over time. While we had limited time to conduct advanced analyses, our research efforts took a significant step forward so that future researchers can more readily integrate these methods into their analyses. These methods will be adopted and expanded by NOAA PAM researchers at a national scale as part of a new PAM strategic initiative."

    "text": "The Adrift project surveyed the California Current between Point Conception to the south and Newport, Oregon to the north. This greater study area was subdivided into three sub-areas: Oregon, Northern California, and Central California. Initial funding (2020) focused on Northern California, ranging from San Francisco to the California-Oregon border, and encompassing the Humboldt Wind Energy Area. In 2021, funding was expanded to include Central California, with focus on the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area. Finally, in 2022 the area studied expanded to include a pilot study in Oregon. In addition to focused data collection efforts, this study analyzed data from two previous offshore surveys: Passive Acoustic Survey of Cetacean Abundance Levels (PASCAL 2016, Keating et al. 2018) and the California Current Ecosystem Survey (CCES 2018, Simonis 2020).\nThe Adrift project started in June 2020, during the COVID-19 Pandemic. All fieldwork in 2020 was canceled due to the pandemic, and these impacts greatly hampered research efforts in 2021. In addition to the initial cessation of all fieldwork efforts, secondary impacts continued to negatively impact fieldwork well into 2022. Secondary impacts included disruptions to the supply chain and extreme short-staffing due to outbreaks and exposure, as well as the widespread post-pandemic changes to the workforce.\nPrior research efforts include the 2016 PASCAL survey and the 2018 CCES survey. These surveys were conducted in late summer through late fall during the post-upwelling season and data collection was not impacted by strong currents or inclement weather. Weather conditions are typically less ideal, and currents stronger, during the upwelling and winter season. The California Current experienced three consecutive years of La Niña between 2020-2022 (Thompson et al. 2024). The increased wind and currents caused by these conditions led to decreased windows of good weather, even during summer. After the initial loss of several drifting recorders due to extreme weather and current conditions, we limited our deployments to good weather windows, which dramatically decreased the duration of our deployments from ~ 30 days during PASCAL (10-19 days) and CCES (10-79 days), to less than 1 week during most of the Adrift study. Strong currents and high seas also created self-noise such as strumming, which periodically impacted data quality. Use of spar buoys instead of hi-flyer pole buoys may be preferred to minimize strumming.\nThe cumulative impacts of the pandemic and poor environmental conditions ultimately required us to shift our survey approach and abandon our efforts to coordinate data collection using vessels of opportunity. Instead, we focused on directed deployment of drifting recorders in collaboration with regional partners. Our partners in Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt) and Oregon (Oregon State University) were able to use a combination of opportunistic and dedicated vessel time for data collection. We partnered with the NOAA Sanctuary Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies (ACCESS) Surveys to collect data offshore San Francisco up to three times per year, and developed a collaborative partnership for fieldwork in Morro Bay."

The first drifting recorder was deployed in fall 2021, with more frequent deployment of clusters of 2-4 buoys starting in spring 2022 (28 total deployments).\nDrifting recorders had previously been deployed in the Humboldt region during the 2018 CCES survey (Appendix C) and the 2019 Express Pilot Survey. Both previous drifts were entrained in the recirculating current offshore Humboldt (Largier et al. 1993) that allowed for repeated sampling during each deployment. Unfortunately, during the Adrift survey these drifting recorders encountered strong southward currents that prevented the repeated sampling provided during previous surveys. The extreme weather conditions, variable currents, and proximity to Cape Mendocino (and lack of ports south of this point) created a high-risk scenario. After the loss of 3 drifting recorders in the first survey year, we reduced deployments to open weather windows to ensure opportunity for retrieval.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of all successful drifts in the Humboldt region during the Adrift project. Drifts deployed during winter are blue, upwelling are green, and post-upwelling are yellow. Wind Energy Areas are outlined in purple.\n\n\n\n\nThe monthly Trinidad Head Line survey provides year-round ship observations of oceanography (hydrographic and biological) and terminates just inside the boundary of the Humboldt WEA. Efforts to deploy monthly during these surveys were complicated by personnel shortages and poor environmental conditions, and deployments were frequently shortened due to prevailing environmental conditions. Data collection in Humboldt was negatively impacted by competition for resources (vessel and seaboard technician time) and poor weather conditions, especially during the winter months. The increasing need for offshore research in the Humboldt WEA combined with the University’s new status as a polytechnic institution suggest collaborative field efforts such as those conducted in Morro Bay may be welcome."

This partnership was mutually beneficial; however, these surveys are only conducted in late spring through late summer. Deployments in the post-upwelling season extended further south than deployments in the upwelling season (Figure 5); these geographic differences may contribute to seasonal differences in marine mammal detections.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot of all successful drifts deployed in the San Francisco region during the Adrift project.

We had difficulty identifying suitable partners for this remote study area and the high cost of vessel charters in the Morro Bay region led us to seek what resulted in a highly successful collaboration with regional scientific partners. After a successful pilot study in June 2022, we initiated the seasonal Central Coast Collaborative passive acoustic monitoring survey (CCC). These highly successful surveys brought together scientists, educators, tribal representatives, and regional community members to collect data, form collaborations, and strengthen bonds across communities to better serve our combined priorities. These surveys allowed us to collect data from clusters of eight drifting recorders during each survey, providing improved geographic coverage during these seasonal surveys. We conducted a total of four CCC surveys with a total of 30 Adrift deployments (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot of all successful drifts in the Morro Bay region during the Adrift project.

Most sperm whale detections were ‘regular’ clicks associated with feeding animals; ‘slow’ clicks (associated with adult males) were uncommon but detected in all regions except Morro Bay (see table, right). Sperm whales were detected in all regions in PASCAL and/or CCES Surveys (Figure 1).\nSperm whales had been documented only 3 times in the waters offshore San Francisco in over 30 years of ACCESS visual surveys (J. Roletto, pers. comm.). Our detection of sperm whales (both regular and slow clicks) from drifting recorders deployed during the ACCESS surveys suggests that passive acoustic monitoring might improve our understanding of sperm whale distribution in the busy shipping lanes off San Francisco as well as within the combined Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary.\n\nPUT TABLE HERE\n\n\nA pilot study examining the potential estimation of body size based on inter-pulse and inter-click intervals found that sperm whale groups detected during November deployments in Morro Bay were comprised of females and juvenile males (see Appendix D).

    "title": "Soundscape",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of soundscape monitoring was to describe the ambient noise level(s) in the California Current Ecosystem (including the Morro Bay and Humboldt Wind Energy Areas) and to identify the major contributors to the soundscape. To that end, we measured soundscape metrics and identified two primary sources of noise: self-noise and ship noise. Weather (wind, rain) is a significant contributor to soundscape and varies by season/region. Although we did not quantify this in our analysis, we recommend that future research include weather as a contributor to the soundscape. These data were combined with the detection of biological sounds from marine mammals to examine the biological and anthropogenic contributors to the soundscape. Soundscape metrics aligned with SanctSound protocols and were measured using Triton (Wiggins and Hildebrand 2007) with the Soundscape Remora. Data were decimated to 48 kHz, and LTSAs were calculated with a 1 Hz, 1 s resolution. The full system calibration value was calculated from the combined hydrophone and SoundTrap sensitivity. Soundscape LTSAs were used to calculate sound levels in 2-minute windows from 100 - 24,000 Hz, including broadband sound pressure levels, third-octave levels, and power spectral densities. Median (50th percentile), mean, and various statistical sound levels (1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles) are calculated for each metric. Soundscape metrics were archived to NCEI and linked with the original raw data.\nThe SanctSound methods were initially adopted to provide data consistent with previously analyzed data. Soundscape methods have changed significantly in the last three years, and the most recent recommendation is to report sound levels in hybrid millidecade bands. While there is now open-source software that can produce these metrics, it was not available for our analysis. All of our data is publicly available and the LTSAs were retained so that the data can be converted in the future. We recommend that data be reanalyzed to report sound levels in hybrid millidecade bands to align with current standards.\nPeriods of low frequency self-noise (strumming, knocking sounds resulting from movement of buoy components) were identified by scanning the 1- or 2-hour LTSA windows created with 500 Hz decimated files (5 Hz and 1 s resolution). Start and end times of noisy data were logged with the highest frequency affected (up to the 250 Hz maximum provided by the 500 Hz decimated data). Noisy data with energy above the 100 Hz lower bounds of the soundscape methods were removed from analysis. Additional details are provided in Github online analysis methods.\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is the measure of the signal’s power as a function of frequency, and the PSD plots provide a visualization of the ambient noise for each region and season (Figure 6.1). Contributing sounds include biological sounds (marine mammals, fish, invertebrates), environmental noise (wind, rain), and anthropogenic noise (vessel noise, depth sounders, seal bombs). While Figure 6.1 includes all contributors to the soundscape, seasonal and regional differences can be informative and provide valuable pre-development information regarding the general soundscape. In general, noise levels ranged from 50 dB re 1uPa to nearly 150 dB re 1uPa, with the highest density of sound in the 75 - 100 dB range (Figure 6.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Power spectral density for Adrift deployments by season and region.\n\n\nOther researchers have developed models to separate the distinct contributions of ship and wind noise to soundscapes (Erbe et al. 2021; ZoBell et al. 2024). These models have been validated with empirical data and can be in close agreement in certain times and places, but validation has been very limited to small spatiotemporal scales. The data collected in offshore waters throughout the California Current by drifting recorders during PASCAL, CCES, and Adrift surveys can be used to validate models which separate wind and shipping contributions to sound levels. This will be an important next step for evaluating changes in the soundscape associated with offshore wind development areas.\nLow frequency noise associated with strumming precluded consistent analysis of soundscape below 100Hz. Future drifting recorder studies should consider alternative configurations that eliminate strumming and other self-noise to allow for broadband soundscape analysis."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ships produce different sounds while operating, such as impulsive signals from ship propeller cavitation or echosounder signals that can be easily identified in the LTSA and confirmed with a spectrogram. Vessel noise was identified by a trained analyst scanning 1-hour LTSA windows using the Logger Remora in Triton (100 Hz and 5 s resolution). Once a ship was identified, 10 s spectrograms were used to confirm identification (2000 point FFT, 75% overlap). Ships were either logged as being broadband (high amplitude with frequency content above 5 kHz) or narrowband/low frequency (lower amplitude). Ship noise was assessed in full for the Adrift study and in part for CCES (not analyzed for PASCAL). Additional details are provided in Github online analysis methods. The manual methods used in this study were time consuming, but our initial efforts to analyze data with an existing ship detector found that the detector was unreliable on identifying ship tracks with our dataset. We recommend development of an open-source approach to vessel detection that includes classification of vessels to vessel type, and integration of this data into a systematic approach to quantifying the contribution of ship noise to the soundscape.\nThe percent of recording hours with vessel presence varied across region, season, and time of day (Figure 6.2). Vessel presence was higher in Oregon and Humboldt than in San Francisco or Morro Bay. Vessel presence in Humboldt shifted from night-time during the upwelling season to daytime during the post-upwelling season (summer), with winter variability likely relating to low effort. Morro Bay region experienced the lowest amount of vessel traffic, with extremely low levels of vessel traffic (&lt;20%) detected in the post-upwelling season.\nHourly presence of ships in San Francisco appears to be lower than other regions (Figure 6.2). Overall sound levels were much higher in this region (Figure 6.1), and may have masked some individual ship passages. Future work can include an Automatic Identification System metric such as the number of unique large vessels with relatively close approaches.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Polar plots of seasonal detection of ship noise in Oregon, Humboldt, San Francisco, and Morro Bay regions. The hourly percent of effort with vessel detections is shown in color ranging from dark blue (0%) to yellow (50%). The diurnal variation in vessel noise is shown by detection in bins on polar plot ranging from 0 to 24 hr of the day (UTC, Universal Time Coordinated)."

Despite the similarities in their echolocation clicks, these species inhabit different habitats and have different behaviors and life histories. Harbor porpoise inhabit the nearshore waters north of Point Conception, and are very sensitive to noise and other anthropogenic impacts. Dall’s porpoise are fast moving and are often found in mixed species aggregations with dolphins. Both the pygmy and dwarf sperm whales are cryptic deep diving species. Lumping these very different species into one ‘acoustic’ group is problematic, and acoustic classification to species (or at least genus) is needed.\nPreliminary efforts at developing a genus-level species classifier for NBHF species in the California Current have shown positive results, and future research will further develop this classifier (see Appendix F). With some improvement, this classifier can be applied towards existing archived data to improve our understanding of the distribution of these species in the greater California Current.\nDetailed methods are provided in our GitHub online analysis methods."

Hourly detection rates of humpback whales were lower for the combined PASCAL and CCES surveys than the Adrift study (Figure 1). Most PASCAL and CCES deployments were further offshore (west) of the Adrift study areas (see drift maps in Appendix B, Appendix C). Historical sighting data shows decreased distribution of humpback whales in these offshore waters (see OBIS Seamap). Humpback whales were not detected in Oregon during the PASCAL and CCES Surveys (Figure 1).\nThere were few acoustic detections of humpback whales during the late June/early July surveys off Morro Bay (Figure 1). Multiple humpback whales were visually sighted during the June 2022 and July 2023 CCC surveys in Morro Bay; however, the bulk of the visual survey effort (and sightings) were south of the area acoustically surveyed. The disconnect between the visual sightings and acoustic detections could be due to local differences in the sampling areas or that the animals were not particularly vocal during this sampling period.\n\nPUT TABLE HERE\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hourly humpback whale events by month, region for Adrift and combined PASCAL, CCES surveys.

Black lines represent total available hours (effort) and red lines represent hours with detections. Blue shading represents winter, green represents upwelling, and yellow represents the post-upwelling oceanographic season.\n\n\nHourly probability of detecting song was higher in the post-upwelling than the upwelling season for Humboldt and San Francisco, but the opposite was true for Morro Bay (see table, above). Deployments were limited in winter, but high probability of detecting humpback song aligns with the production of song during the southern winter migration (Clapham and Mattila 1990). There were several drifts in which humpback song dominated the recordings (Figure 2). The acoustic features of humpback whale song, including high source level and series of calls produced over long time spans, naturally lead to high detection rates (Au et al. 2006). While recordings dominated by song may be attributed to one or a few animals, social sounds may be attributed to larger numbers of animals (Ryan et al. 2019). There were few detections of humpback song in Oregon.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hourly presence of humpback song, social calls by month, region for Adrift. Hourly presence of humpback song (left) and humpback social calls (right)(y axis) for different months for combined years (x axis) and for each region (Oregon, Humboldt, San Francisco, and Morro Bay).

Black lines represent total available hours (effort) and red lines represent hours with detections. Blue shading represents winter, green represents upwelling, and yellow represents the post-upwelling oceanographic season.\n\n\nHumpback whales produce many non-song (social) calls that may be associated with feeding or social behaviors.  Humpback whale social sounds most frequently detected in these analyses included the grunts, ‘wops’ and ‘thwops’ (Dunlop et al. 2008). We were unable to dedicate the time required to differentiate these sounds during this study. Highly annotated datasets exist, and we recommend development of machine learning models to classify humpback non-song, which may allow for an improved understanding of spatial and temporal variation in habitat use in the California Current, allowing us to identify potential critical habitat. \nDetailed methods are provided in our GitHub online analysis methods."

Detection of fin whales during the combined PASCAL/CCES surveys showed strong presence in the Morro Bay and San Francisco regions, with low detections in Humboldt and Oregon (Figure 1).\nFin whale 20 Hz pulses had higher detection probabilities in the post-upwelling seasons for all locations (see table, right, and @fin-ADRIFT_fin2040_HourlyPresence). This detection probability dropped during the (limited) winter data for Humboldt. Fin whale 20 Hz detections were lower off San Francisco than other areas, though detection of low frequency fin whale calls in this area may be compromised by low frequency noise associated with high levels of low frequency noise associated with large shipping traffic (container ships).\n\nPUT TABLE HERE\n\n\nThe fin whale 20 Hz call is the most commonly reported and is thought to be used as a social call to establish and maintain contact when produced in irregular sequences (Edds-Walton 1997) and it may serve a reproductive function when produced by males in a regular sequence forming song (Croll et al. 2002). Here we did not differentiate between irregular and regular sequencing.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hourly fin whale events by month, region for Adrift and combined PASCAL, CCES surveys.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Drifting recorders consist of a hydrophone array and autonomous recorder at depth with a surface buoy and satellite GPS at the surface to allow for tracking and retrieval (Figure 1). Components are continually modified to address problems and accommodate improved technologies.\nThe surface buoy transitioned from a spar buoy to a high-flyer pole buoy after CCES and prior to Adrift in an effort to minimize buoy loss due to ship strike. The pole buoy includes a radar reflector for visibility and a satellite GPS tracker mounted to the pole. Pole buoys included the now discontinued Lindgren-Pitman high-flyer buoy, a custom high-flyer developed by Fisherman Dick Ogg, and a custom in-house high-flyer pole buoy. Initial GPS trackers included two SPOT GPS trackers (for redundancy) mounted in a waterproof canister on the pole buoy. The modifications made to these trackers to increase their battery power led to increased failure (modifications weakened the units). These were replaced with Solar GPS that were easier to use, more robust, and could be used for extended periods with solar recharge of the internal battery.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Drifting Recorder Diagram\n\n\n\n\nA trawl float was attached to the surface buoy with a short length of floating line to allow for retrieval using a grappling hook.\nThe hydrophone array, recorder, and ancillary components were deployed vertically from the surface trawl float, with the hydrophone array and recorder located 100 or 150 m depth. While movement of the surface buoys would be affected by wind, variable surface currents, and swell height, instrumentation at depth were minimally affected by modest and relatively stable subsurface current. The different forces at the surface and depth occasionally led to strumming of the line and hydrophones. Additional ancillary components were added in 2022 to minimize vertical and horizontal movement of the instruments, reduce tension induced strumming, and reduce displacement of hydrophones from a vertical orientation. Also, several initial losses were due (at least in part) to failures in the primary vertical line; this line was replaced with a significantly stronger line that eliminated this failure point.\nTo improve vertical alignment of the hydrophones at depth, a subsurface trawl float was placed immediately above the instruments, with a 30 lb mushroom anchor below the instruments. This effectively reduced vertical displacement of the hydrophone array. A small drogue was used to decrease horizontal movement of the hydrophone array at depth, and a dampener plate was used to minimize vertical movement. While these helped alleviate tension and movement that attributed to strumming noise, an additional bungee was added to the line to further reduce strumming. The anchor was attached using a small rope with low breaking strength as a ‘weak-link’ to mitigate entanglement risk.\nThe acoustic recording equipment consisted of a two-element vertical hydrophone array below the recorder. A Sensus Ultra depth sensor was attached directly above the top hydrophone and recorded depth at 60s intervals. The top hydrophone consisted of an HTI-92WB and the lower hydrophone consisted of an HTI-96min positioned 5m below the top hydrophone. Recorders consisted of either the (now discontinued) SoundTrap 4300 or the SoundTrap 640 which allowed for extended deployments (Ocean Instruments, NZ).\nInitial recordings included a duty cycle to extend deployment, and then all recordings shifted to continuous sampling. Sample rate varied according to the instrument, with a minimum sample rate of 288 kHz. A summary of deployment details can be found in Adrift Expanded Datasets.\nMore information on drifting recorder components and design can be found on our GitHub pages for Adrift field methods. Methods for drifting recorders deployed during PASCAL and CCES can be found in their respective reports (Keating et al. 2018; Simonis 2020)\nResults\nClustered drifting recorders provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the contributors to the soundscape. Preliminary results suggest that clustered drifting recorders can be used to reduce the possible range of sound source location (see Appendix: Modeling Habitat Use) and can provide information on the spatial variation in soundscape (see Spatial Variation in Noise). Drifting recorders were deployed in clusters of 4 in Humboldt and Oregon study areas, and in clusters of 8 in the Morro Bay Study area. In some cases, drifting recorders in close proximity to each other followed dramatically different drift trajectories.\nThere were multiple cases of equipment and data loss, especially during the initial deployments. Losses were due to a variety of reasons, including inclement weather, strong currents, and recorder failures. We mitigated these problems through modifying components and altering survey methods. A number of gear modifications were made to improve robustness and to decrease self-noise that interfered with recording quality. We recommend additional buoy modification to reduce noise associated with strong currents and inclement weather. Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) will be using an alternative buoy design developed by Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center during the CalCurCEAS 2024 survey, which may reduce strumming noise.\nDrifting acoustic recorders are not appropriate for all geographic regions. We recommend conducting a regional pilot study to determine the region-specific environmental conditions, and to identify local partners. The Humboldt study area was especially affected by strong currents combined with the close proximity of the study area to Cape Mendocino, in which options for retrieval south of Cape Mendocino are rare. The success of the CCC-PAM survey in Morro Bay included the financial benefit of sharing vessel resources, improved scientific collaborations, and it provided an opportunity for scientists to share and learn from other community members. We recommend consideration of a collaborative fieldwork pilot study in Humboldt and other regions.\nThere were multiple recorder failures, and different problems were associated with different recording models, including: failure to start, instrument flooding, and low received levels on one or more channels. Initial deployments (including the previous PASCAL and CCES Surveys) used the multi-channel SoundTrap ST4300, which is easy to use and provides high quality recording for up to four channels (max 256 Gb flash drive, battery for 4-5 days continuous recording). Recorder failures for these devices included failure to start (instrument failure or user error) and low received levels on one or more channels. The SoundTrap ST4300 was discontinued and replaced by the higher capacity SoundTrap ST640 in 2021. The SoundTrap ST640 with removable components can accommodate up to 2Tb memory and has battery capacity for up to 90 days. This newer model provided the capacity needed for continuous recordings but required significantly more experience to use and had an increased risk of failure due to leaks. Four 640s were lost during a sea trial and one was lost during Adrift data collection effort.\nDrifting acoustic recorders contain instrumentation at depth, and are not appropriate for use on the continental shelf. Seafloor recorders should be used for nearshore monitoring in depths less than 300 m."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of the Adrift project was to collect baseline data to identify which marine mammal species frequent the Morro Bay, Humboldt, and Oregon Wind Energy Areas, and to describe their seasonal occurrence and distribution within the greater California Current Ecosystem. Different call types are understood to be associated with specific behaviors and therefore provide information related to habitat use. For mysticete (baleen) whales, we focused on blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (B. physalus), Bryde’s whales (B. edeni), sei whales (B. borealis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and minke whales (B. acutorostrata). For odontocetes (toothed whales), we focused on sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), beaked whales (all regional species), dolphins (including Risso’s dolphins, Grampus griseus, and Pacific white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and narrow band high frequency (NBHF) species (harbor porpoise, Phoceona phocoena, Dall’s porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli, and Kogia spp.). Passive acoustic monitoring relies on sounds produced by animals for detection, and therefore PAM studies cannot identify the absence of animals. Data analysis for fin, sei, and Bryde’s whales was contracted through OSA (Ocean Science Analytics). Specific details on detection methods are provided in our GitHub Analysis Methods.\nRaw data were shipped from regional partners to SWFSC for archiving, pre-processing, and acoustic analysis of marine mammals and ambient noise (soundscape). Deployment metadata and species detection metadata were stored to a Tethys database stored on a local server. Data and metadata were archived to National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and detection data products were archived at the Pacific Acoustic Cetacean Map (PACM) (see Data Sharing).\nPrior to analysis, compressed SUD (Symantec UndoData) data files stored on the SoundTrap recorders were downloaded, extracted, and decimated to 500Hz, 12 kHz, and 48 kHz. A series of full bandwidth Long Term Spectra Averages (LTSAs) were generated using Triton software with 200 Hz, 5 s resolution. LTSAs were then scanned to assess overall data quality and to identify recording data start and end times. A series of custom quality assurance and quality control functions provided a check for appropriate time format, eliminated spurious GPS tracks, and identified unexpected recording gaps. More information on pre-processing methods can be found on GitHub.\nOur intention was to develop a streamlined open-source workflow for passive acoustic analysis that would promote reproducible research. Raw recording data were processed and analyzed to detect the presence of calls associated with mysticete species (blue, fin, Bryde’s, sei, humpback, gray, and minke whales) and odontocete species (sperm whales, beaked whales, dolphins, and species known to produce narrow-band high frequency sounds (porpoise and Kogia spp.)). Presence of sounds were noted in hourly bins; and detection methods varied by species. Analysis was not conducted on recordings deemed unusable due to excessive self-noise. In addition, an acoustic event of unknown species (possible sei/blue whale) was detected on Adrift-060 off Oregon in 2023. This extended acoustic encounter includes a number of frequency-modulated call types. More information can be found in our GitHub Repository.\nInitially, our ability to access and process our archived data was extremely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our archived data was largely inaccessible for the first 6 - 12 months, and we were limited to small scale processing on our laptops. Early on we initiated the purchase of a larger server that would allow larger scale remote processing of archived data, but supply chain issues and a series of technical problems delayed use for an additional 18 months. Between accessibility and supply chain issues associated with the pandemic, processing archived data took significantly more time than expected. The cumulative effect of these problems resulted in decreased opportunity to provide higher level analysis within the timeframe of this study. Where possible, we have provided preliminary analysis within the appendices to understand potential for future analysis."

Similar to the overall Adrift project, blue whales were detected in all regions during the combined PASCAL/CCES surveys, with low detections of blue whales off Oregon (Figure 1).\nDetection of blue whale calls were primarily A and B calls associated with song, with few detections of D calls during the summer months (Figure 2).\nBlue whale ‘song’ consists of both A and B calls, which can occur individually or in A-B pairs. Detection of both A and B calls were higher during the post-upwelling seasons in all areas (see table, right). The hourly probability of detecting blue whale A and B calls during the limited data off Humboldt in the winter were higher than during the upwelling season, but lower than the post-upwelling season.\n\nPut Table HEre\n\n\nThere were only a few blue whale B calls detected during the upwelling season off San Francisco; no other calls associated with song were detected during the upwelling season in any region. The probability of detecting blue whale B calls was consistently higher than A calls for all regions (and seasons), which reflects research showing that blue whale B calls can be detected at greater ranges than blue whale A calls (McDonald et al. 2001). Blue whale B calls can be readily classified by an experienced analyst when the SNR (signal to noise ratio) is low.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hourly blue whale events by month, region for Adrift and combined PASCAL, CCES surveys.

The probability of detecting D calls was much lower than detecting A and/or B calls, and there were no detection of D calls off Oregon (see table, above). Low SNR D calls are more readily confused with low frequency downsweep calls produced by other species, reducing the overall effective detection range for these calls. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hourly presence of blue whale D calls by month, region for Adrift.

Black lines represent total available hours (effort) and red lines represent hours with detections. Blue shading represents winter, green represents upwelling, and yellow represents the post-upwelling oceanographic season.\n\n\nThere had been no visual detection of beaked whales during the 30 years of annual ACCESS surveys offshore San Francisco (J. Roletto, pers. comm.). The drifting recorders deployed during the ACCESS surveys detected both Baird’s and goose-beaked whales, suggesting that beaked whales do occur in and near the shipping lanes and the combined Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries (Figure 2). The discrepancy in these detections is likely due to the typically poor sighting conditions in this region and the cryptic surfacing behavior of beaked whales. Future surveys in this region should consider passive acoustic monitoring with sufficient bandwidth to detect echolocating beaked whales.\nMany of the beaked whale detections in Morro Bay occurred during times with large numbers of dolphin detections (see ?@fig-Adrift_MorroBay22_Seasons, ?@fig-Adrift_MorroBay23_Seasons for a visualization of this co-occurrence). Dolphins frequently occur in large schools with many animals echolocating simultaneously. It can be very difficult to identify beaked whales (smaller group sizes where fewer clicks are detected from each group) in these situations.  The vertical hydrophone array allows for the estimation of bearing angles of incoming echolocation clicks. Beaked whales echolocate at depths below the vertical array, providing bearing angles &gt; 90⁰ on the hydrophone array, while dolphins are typically above the array (bearing angles &lt; 90⁰). By segregating the data based on bearing angle, we were able to identify groups of echolocating beaked whales during times where there were large numbers of echolocating dolphins. The co-occurrence of dolphins and beaked whales has not been previously reported, and it is unclear what may bring these species together. The likelihood of detecting beaked whales in these mixed species encounters would have been very low if recordings were collected from a single, seafloor sensor or from towed hydrophone arrays.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hourly goose-beaked whales and Baird’s beaked whales by month, region.

We developed an open-source R package RoboJ (Robotic Jay) for these methods (see Appendix A). We explored automated event definition based on MTC (matched template classifier) scores and developed a process that identified every manually labeled event, but ultimately included an unacceptable number of false detections. The inclusion of a computer vision model was helpful for separating false detections; however, data processing times and classification rates were not acceptable. Current ideas to improve performance of automated event definition are discussed in Appendix A. Data were prepared for future density estimation, but density estimates were not completed for Adrift or CCES survey data."

    "text": "The goal of the Adrift in the California Current Project (‘Adrift’) was to use passive acoustic drifting recorders deployed offshore the U.S. West Coast to assess the distribution of marine mammals and to characterize the marine soundscape. This three-year study was initiated in the Northern California region in 2020, was extended to Central California in 2021, and an additional pilot study off Oregon was initiated in 2022. A concerted effort was made to develop a streamlined open-source workflow for passive acoustic analysis that would promote reproducible research, with all methods, data, and metadata being publicly accessible. This report outlines methods, results, and recommendations for future research.\nWhy PAM?\n\nTraditional shipboard surveys to assess marine mammal populations are expensive generally conducted intermittently (every 5 years) during summer and fall seasons\nTraditional shipboard visual observation methods are difficult during poor weather conditions and during times of low visibility (including night)\nThese data suffer from spatial and temporal gaps, especially for cryptic species.\nSound is the primary sensory modality of marine mammals and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) allows for monitoring marine mammals and characterization of the overall soundscape.\n\nWhy Drifting Recorders?\n\nTraditional PAM platforms vary in strengths and limitations:\n\nTowing hydrophones behind a ship provides good geographic resolution, but poor temporal resolution; recordings at surface near ship noise & far from deep diving species\nSeafloor hydrophones allow for good temporal resolution, but poor geographic resolution. Seafloor hydrophones are limited in depth of deployment, and recorders are far from near-surface species.\n\nDrifting recorders:\n\nCan record for weeks or months (depending on recording characteristics and local currents),\nLow cost allows for deployment of multiple instruments, which increases spatial coverage and provides a model for intermediate geographic and temporal resolution.\nHydrophones positioned near animals in the water column (neither at surface nor seafloor)\n\n\nDrifting recorders have been increasingly deployed during large scale shipboard surveys to augment visual line-transect surveys for cryptic and deep-diving species (Keating et al. 2018; Simonis 2020), and methods have been developed to estimate density and abundance of goose-beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) (Barlow et al. 2021). As drifting recorders are not tethered to the seafloor or to a ship, they have shown potential as an alternative PAM platform for the wind energy areas identified in the deep waters offshore the U.S. West Coast."

Development of the RoboJ tool to streamline a systematic approach to density estimation was based off the process developed by SWFSC in (Barlow et al. 2022) and it was generalized for adoption by other researchers (see RoboJ GitHub Repository ). While most of the process is now streamlined, there remains a significant manual effort for identifying acoustic events. Our team initiated a process for improving automation of this tedious process, however they were unable to complete the automation of identifying acoustic events and we recommend investing in this development in the future (see Appendix: Open Science for more details on development of a beaked whale matched template classifier). The RoboJ tool has been tested by colleagues at Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, and documentation and final preparation of the software is underway.\nRoboJ Pipeline:\n\n·        Incorporates acoustic detections stored in PAMGuard databases and binaries.\n·        Estimate detection range based on incoming bearing angle, presumed foraging depth, and modeled sound speed profile at each position.\n·        Estimate detection function for recorders\n\nThe original research was developed for the PASCAL dataset, and we have prepared the CCES 2018 dataset for analysis, but we were unable to complete the analysis in the timeframe of this study. These methods will be used for the CalCurCEAS 2024 survey data, and if opportunity allows, analysis will also be completed for the CCES 2018 dataset.\nFuture research should consider (1) funding further development of an automated approach to acoustic event delineation, (2) beaked whale density estimation for the Adrift dataset, and (3) expansion of this analysis to species beyond goose-beaked whales."

PAMGuard’s (v2.02.09) whistle and moan detector was used to detect calls associated with Bryde’s (Be4) and sei whales (frequency modulated downsweep calls identified in Rankin and Barlow (2007)). Potential calls were reviewed by an experienced OSA analyst in PAMGuard’s Viewer Mode. Detections were grouped into acoustic events using the Detection Group Localiser module. Acoustic events were then binned into hourly presence for the presence of Bryde’s and sei whales. Deployments with excessive self-noise (such as strumming) that consistently impacted our ability to detect Bryde’s and sei whales were eliminated from this analysis. Detailed methods are provided in our GitHub online analysis methods and an OSA Report archived on our GitHub repository.\nResults There were no confirmed detections of calls associated with Bryde’s or sei whales during Adrift, and a single possible sei whale encounter was detected during PASCAL (see spectrogram of possible sei whale in GitHub Repository).\nBryde’s whale distribution is in the tropical and subtropical waters, with occasional northward incursion into the Southern California Bight (Kerosky et al. 2012). The Adrift deployments were north of Point Conception (and the Southern California Bight), and it is not unexpected to fail to detect animals on our recordings. Warming oceans associated with climate change may lead to more consistent detection of these species in the California Current, and these detections may occur in increasingly northern latitudes over time. We recommend that future acoustic studies in the California Current include detection of Bryde’s whales.\nLittle is known about sei whales in the North Pacific, and to our knowledge there is only one confirmed recording of sei whales in the North Pacific, near Hawaii (Rankin and Barlow 2007). Future research should take advantage of opportunities to understand the vocal repertoire of sei whales in the North Pacific Ocean."

While dolphins were detected in all regions during the PASCAL and CCES surveys, they were more frequently detected in the San Francisco and Morro Bay regions during the Adrift study. Dolphin detections included detections that could be positively attributed to Risso’s dolphins (Gg) and Pacific white-sided Dolphins (Lo), and detections that remained unidentified (UO) (see table, right). Dolphin acoustic events attributed to Unidentified Odontocetes (UO) were uncommon relative to the number of detections of Risso’s and/or Pacific white-sided dolphins.\nDolphin schools in central and northern California are frequently encountered in large, dispersed mixed species groups (S.Rankin, pers. comm.), and here we do not distinguish mixed species from single-species groups. So, attribution of an acoustic event to Risso’s dolphins does not preclude the presence of other species. We currently lack a comprehensive acoustic classification routine that includes all dolphin schools in the region. Future research should develop a publicly available acoustic classifier for dolphins that considers mixed species groups and can be applied to different passive acoustic platforms.\n\nPut Table Here\n\n\nPrevious research identified different click types for Pacific white-sided dolphins (Soldevilla et al. 2010). The dominant click type in Adrift acoustic encounters of Pacific white-sided dolphins was ‘Type A’; however, there were some encounters with ‘Type B’. Most of these Type A encounters were at night, similar to Soldevilla et al. (2010), and our research identified a co-occurrence of Click Type A with goose-beaked whale (see Beaked Whales). Future research could investigate this relationship between Pacific white-sided dolphins and goose-beaked whales by taking advantage of the vertical array for separating animals echolocating at the surface and at depth. Soldevilla et al. (2010) suggested Type B echolocation clicks might be attributed to a nearshore population in the southern California Current (Southern California Bight and Baja Mexico); however, our results show that Click Type B can be found in other regions.\nFuture investigation in the geographic variation in click types for Pacific white-sided dolphins is merited.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Hourly dolphin events by month, region for Adrift and combined PASCAL, CCES surveys.

Black lines represent total available hours (effort) and red lines represent hours with detections.

The dominant click type in all acoustic encounters of Risso’s dolphins in our analysis was the “Pelagic Pacific” (PPac) click type. Previous models had limited sample sizes from Risso’s dolphins in open ocean waters, and future investigations should incorporate the acoustic detections from Adrift, PASCAL, and CCES to improve the definition of geographic variation in click types throughout the North Pacific Ocean.\nOpportunistic acoustic recordings were collected in the presence of dolphin groups with visually confirmed species, including single and mixed assemblages of Pacific white-sided, North Pacific right whale, Risso’s, and common dolphins. The sample sizes are currently too low to be used to develop classification models, but these recordings will be useful contributions to training datasets in the future.\nDetailed methods are provided in our GitHub online analysis methods."

    "section": "",
    "text": "OSA was tasked with processing low frequency drifting recorder data for the explicit purpose of identifying the occurrence of 40 Hz calls from fin whales and calls from sei whales. A related analytical objective was to develop an improved method of detecting fin whale low-frequency calls within obscure acoustic environments using a deep learning approach. Using a deep learning network development and detection tool DeepAcoustics, we iteratively tested ideal image and network parameters for the calls procured from the data review process. Network development encompassed training with both 20 Hz and 40 Hz whale call types and resulted in successful detection despite excessive instrument noise within the dataset.\nData were evaluated in two ways, by assessing performance in comparison to an annotated test file and by comparing the network detection performance to our semi-automated PAMGuard processing approach, which involves a human in the loop to classify calls and assign to an acoustic encounter. After identifying 40 Hz and 20 Hz calls in the PAMGuard approach, we annotated approximately 1,400 calls in Raven to include in network training. Annotations of 20 Hz calls from another dataset were included to increase sample size.\nThree network architectures were evaluated: tiny YOLO (You Only Look Once), CSP-DarkNet-53, and the ResNet-50. We tested performance using a separate set of annotated calls and assessed performance in the absence of vocalizations with varying degrees of instrument noise. Extensive instrument noise and small sample size contribute to performance metrics; however, we considered these results favorable considering the degree of noise (Table G 1).\n[ADD TABLE]\nWhen incorporating false positive rates in the evaluation, the tiny YOLO and CSP-DarkNet-53 demonstrate the additional benefit of deep network development (see detailed report on GitHub repository).\nThe next step was to evaluate the performance of the network on a larger dataset, as the aim of network development is to derive a model that can process a dataset both quickly and accurately. The Adrift-083 dataset was selected because it contained fin whale 40 Hz calls and blue whale D calls. In the figure below, both types of calls are included in the PAMGuard annotations, and blue whale D calls are known to result in false positives for this version of the network. Humpback whale social calls were also present but were not annotated in our review (thus not represented in these figures). Over the seven-day period of this drift, the detection pattern by the PAMGuard method (approximately six hours to process) was matched by the detection pattern of DeepAcoustics (approximately 30 minutes to process). A low false positive rate during periods without calls was consistent across the drift (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of hourly detections of fin whale calls from PAMGuard and DeepAcoustics Methods.\n\n\nDeep learning is indispensable for managing the immense volumes of acoustic data, facilitating efficient processing and precise analysis of extensive datasets. This capability is critical for fulfilling the monitoring requirements of organizations such as NOAA and BOEM, ensuring timely and thorough assessment of marine environments and protected species.\nFuture research should consider further enhancing network performance by integrating multi-class training for blue whale D calls and expanding the sample size of the training dataset. Research should consider developing networks tailored for challenging calls like these, as well as for additional species, to make them accessible for public use. OSA is also collaborating with the PAMGuard software developers to enable the integration of DeepAcoustics models into their detection platform. Future funding should consider processing archival data in BOEM repository using the developed networks."

    "text": "In order to consider passive acoustic data for population assessment of marine mammals, these methods must account for varying detection probabilities due to uncertainty in the source location and with changing background noise levels.\nThe clustered deployments off Morro Bay provide a test bed for evaluating the ability of drifting recorders to contribute to population assessment models. Mysticete calls can be detected on multiple instruments; however, localization of the sound source is limited by gaps in known sensor location (30 min GPS updates). As part of the exploratory analysis, we built a simulation of fin whale habitat use using regional density estimates, simplified propagation models and noise levels from one Morro Bay datasets. This simulation examined the potential spatial resolution of calls given the changing spacing of recorders throughout the deployment.\nWe simulated 4,000 calls distributed in the survey area according to predicted fin whale densities by (Becker et al. 2020) (Figure 1). We determined the minimum spatial resolution to which each call could potentially be localized using between 1 and 7 of the drifting recorders to compare the tradeoffs between localization resolution and the number of sensors.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tracks of 8 clustered drifting recorders with simulated fin whale call density. Filled area represents simulated fin whale call density based on (Becker et al. 2020). Black lines indicate the drift path.\n\n\nThe proposed method is a grid approach that asks whether or not a call could have been produced by an animal in each of the grid cells within the survey region. The method involves two steps and accounts for spatial uncertainty throughout.\nThe first step in the localization method considers known biological parameters of the species and the measured SNR of the arriving call to determine the minimum and maximum range at which a call could have arrived.\nSNR is defined as the Source level of a call minus the noise level at the sensor and the transmission loss over the range between the source and sensor.[1] Thus, if a call arrives at a sensor with an SNR of 45 dB, the ambient noise level in the fin whale band was 120 dB, then we can use knowledge of source level distribution to estimate the minimum and maximum range of each call. If fin whale source levels range between 170 and 190 dB then we know the animal must have been 3.6 to 46.4 km from the receiver. Thus, an annulus (doughnut!) of potential call origin centered at each drifting recorder location is created for each call. This information is particularly informative by itself but with multiple drifting recorders the annuli can be overlapped to narrow down the region of origin (Figure 2).\nThe second step applies to calls that were detected on two or more drifting recorders. In this case, the time-difference-of arrival, with associated positional error, is used to further limit the region of origin established in the first step.\n[1] https://github.com/JPalmerK/AmbiguityGrids\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Variability in sound source location using multiple sensors. Potential location of a source (red point) as detected by each of the drifting recorders (green star) at a given point during the deployment. Black areas represent the region from which the call could have originated according to the arrival SNR at each drifting recorder. Note the call was not detected by Adrift-047 and as such only a minimum location is known (left). The potential region of origin for the call based on the intersection of all drifting recorders (right).\n\n\nUsing the above approach, we estimated the area associated with each region of origin produced from the calls in the simulation (4,000 calls). The histogram densities show a bi-modal distribution with a low region size associated with larger numbers of drifting recorders, and larger region size associated with lower numbers of drifting recorders (?@fig-Adrift_Appendix_HabitatMod_HistSpatialRes3). The scatterplot provides the mean and 95% confidence intervals of the regions of origin based on the number of sensors deployed in the array (Figure 3) The majority of the calls were in the southern portion of the survey area and calls in these regions could only be detected by one or two instruments at most.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Histogram densities and scatterplot of estimated sound source location size based on number of drifting recorders. Histogram densities (left) for the estimated total size of the sound source location for all calls in the simulation for different numbers of drifting recorders (shown as color). Scatterplot (right) of region size for different numbers of drifting recorders.\n\n\nThis preliminary modeling suggests that the dispersed sensors provided by the clustered deployment of multiple drifting recorders can allow for reducing the possible source location for sounds detected on multiple sensors. This improved spatial resolution of the sound source may improve the viability for using these data for population assessment.  Future research should test these analytical methods on real data such as those provided during the Morro Bay surveys and identify how these methods can be used for population assessment."

    "title": "Acoustics Classification of NBHF Species",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are four known cetacean species that produce NBHF echolocation clicks in the California Current Ecosystem, including harbor, Dall’s porpoise, as well as dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and Kogia breviceps, respectively). These species all produce NBHF clicks with similar acoustic features (peak frequency greater than 100 kHz and 3 dB bandwidth less than 10 kHz), and to date, the species cannot be distinguished acoustically. Their presence in acoustic surveys is generally reported within a “NBHF” category; however, each species has distinct habitat preferences (Carretta 2023), and likely responds differently to anthropogenic impacts and environmental stressors. We build upon unsupervised clustering methods developed by (Griffiths et al. 2020) by adding visually-verified species assignments to train an event level classification model in a supervised approach. This work also expands on a San Francisco State University master’s thesis by Jackson VanFleet-Brown (thesis will be publicly available summer 2024 ).\nVisually verified acoustic recordings for Dall’s and harbor porpoises from PASCAL, CCES, and Adrift surveys and NBHF clicks in the offshore waters of Baja California (Kogia spp. are the only NBHF here) were used as a training dataset (Table F 1) to train a 2-stage BANTER (BioAcoustic EveNT ClassifiER) model. Click detections were assigned to a detector category based on the presence of a peak frequency below 125 kHz (lo-range) and greater than 125 kHz (hi-range). A suite of features was calculated for each click detection using the R package PAMpal, and the median inter-click interval for each event was included as an event-level feature. The model was trained in an iterative way to achieve high classification accuracy and stability. The classification model was then used to predict labels on the Adrift survey data.\n[ADD TABLE]\nThe classification accuracy of the BANTER model was 83% overall (Figure F 1), ranging from 77% for harbor porpoise to 93% for Dall’s porpoise. All classification results were greater than expected by chance (see priors in Figure F 1).\nDall’s porpoise were the dominant species found in all study areas and seasons, accounting for 91% (n=2,836 of 3093 events) of NBHF detections overall. Harbor porpoises were detected in all study areas, although 54% (n=105 of 192) of events were detected during the upwelling season in Oregon. Only 2% (n=65 of 3093) of all NBHF events were attributed to Kogia spp., and 77% (n=50) of these events occurred within the San Francisco and Morro Bay study areas.\n{#fig-images/nbhf_bantModel fig-alt=“NBHF BANTER classification results including a (a) confusion matrix, (b) proximity plot, (c) importance heat map, and (d) vote plot. The confusion matrix results include an overall classification result of 83% correct classification for the combined species, with 92% for Kogia spp., 93% for Dall’s porpoise, and 77% for harbor porpoise. All results are much higher than the expected results based on sample size (priors; 17%, 20% and 62%, respectively). The proximity plot provides a view of the distribution of the events within the classification model space. The x and y axes represent two of the model dimensions, and events are labeled based on their classification result. The proximity plot shows strong segregation between Kogia spp. and the porpoise based on these features. The importance heat map shows that the high frequency ranges were the most important variables for this model. The vote plot shows the strength of the classification scores. Most of the Kogia spp. classifications were very strong, with weaker results for the porpoise species.”}\nThis NBHF acoustic classifier can then be used to predict on archived Adrift NBHF detections to better resolve the three separate taxa in the California Current, including Kogia spp., Dall’s and harbor porpoises (?@fig-images/nbhf_bantModel). The overall classification accuracy of the model (83%) is acceptable, however there are several avenues to improve the model. Recently, (Zahn et al. 2024) reported significant gains in BANTER model performance by considering the ratios of third-octave levels at specific frequencies. The mean spectra of each class within our training data indicate distinct distributions of spectral energy in each class, and the inclusion of a third octave level ratio (or other similar metric) may improve model performance. Additionally, the use of an iterative training approach merits consideration. Acoustic events that are labeled with high probabilities can be included when re-training a new model (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Maps with drift tracks and predicted species labels for NBHF events. Maps with drift tracks shown in gray and predicted species labels for NBHF events including *Kogia* spp. (Ks, blue), Dall’s porpoise (Pd, pink) and harbor porpoise (Pp, yellow).\n\n\nThis iterative approach would be biased toward acoustic events most similar to the original training dataset, however the gains from including additional variation in an increased sample size should be evaluated. The development of a more robust classification model should be investigated, but the model we report here has sufficient classification performance to apply to Kogia-specific species habitat models, investigations of species-specific responses to disturbance, and the potential development of acoustic density estimates."

    "text": "There is a concerted effort to understand whether and how ambient noise levels change between the baseline, construction, and operational phases of offshore wind farms and how this may affect different species present in the region. These baseline data are critical to monitor changes in sound levels from anthropogenic sources in space and time as activities related to offshore wind development increase.\nSound pressure levels vary as a function of three-dimensional location as well as time. Vertical placement of sensors will lead to different propagation conditions due to the temperature profile and thermocline, through surface and bottom reflections, and proximity to noise sources. Understanding the spatial extent of noise is a particularly challenging question for single sensor studies. Some of the principal questions needing to be addressed include, are the noise levels measured at a given hydrophone representative of those experienced by the species monitored? How do assumptions about frequency bands and integration periods (e.g., minutes vs. hours) vary over space?\nThe Adrift study project uses clusters of drifting recorders to produce snapshots of ambient noise levels and animal presence in wind energy areas that compliment single sensor seafloor hydrophones. With these buoys, we can begin to document spatial variability in soundscapes, validate propagation models, and better understand how well single sensors represent sound within the greater region.\nA preliminary examination of the spatial cohesion of ambient noise levels was conducted across an array of 7 recorders drifting for 8 days in the Morro Bay region. Figure I 1 shows the 2-minute median noise level in two third octave bins. Considerable variation in noise levels were observed in the first few days across both third octave bins with considerable variation in the 20 kHz bin. Storms moving through the area during the second half of the deployment raised the baseline noise levels nearly uniformly.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Time series of noise levels in 500 Hz and 20 kHz third octave bin. Time series of noise levels recorded by the drifting recorders in the 500 Hz third octave bin (top) and the 20 kHz third octave bin (bottom).\n\n\nThe cohesion of these noise levels can be quantified using correlation scores. Correlation scores measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between multiple measurements. Scores range from -1, indicating a perfectly inverse relationship between noise levels at different locations, and +1 indicating a perfect and positive correlation between noise levels at different locations. In order to assume that noise levels are similar across the study area, we would expect correlation scores between all instruments at or approaching 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Time series of noise levels in 500 Hz and 20 kHz third octave bin. Time series of noise levels recorded by the drifting recorders in the 500 Hz third octave bin (top) and the 20 kHz third octave bin (bottom).\n\n\nFigure I‑2 shows positive correlation between all drifting recorders within the region with scores ranging between 0.7 and 0.91 in the 500 Hz band and 0.64 and 0.83 in the 20 kHz band. This indicates that, on average, noise levels were somewhat correlated over the deployment and that noise levels from more closely spaced units were more highly correlated, as expected. Much of this correlation is attributed to the regional scale storms that uniformly affected the area.\nBecause the data from the drifting recorders inherently cover both space and time, we can model sound levels across the entire region (Figure I‑3). This pre-storm modelled data provides a view of the soundscape averaged across the region. The brighter colors (relating to higher noise levels) in the northwest were attributed to the approaching storm.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Noise map from clustered drifting recorders off Morro Bay.

The Morro Bay WEA is outlined in gold and drift tracks are provided as black lines. The modelled noise level before the storm is provided in color, ranging from 76 dB in dark blue to 86 dB in bright yellow.\n\n\nThis preliminary exploration of the data highlights some interesting spatial aspects of noise that warrant further investigation. Future analyses may include:\n\n·        Evaluate noise levels as a function of distance between sensors. Quantifying this relationship will help to validate propagation models and improve future estimates of noise levels from disparate sensors.\n·        Parse environmental and anthropogenic contributions to noise levels. Depth-dependent empirical models for wind-generated noise can be applied to drifting recorders (Hildebrand et al. 2021). Then, subtraction of wind-associated noise allows evaluation of sound maps such as Figure I‑3 for biological and anthropogenic activity.\nEvaluate depth-dependent changes in ambient noise levels. Sound levels recorded by drifting recorders can be compared with bottom-moored sensors to measure depth dependent changes in ambient noise levels. This is particularly relevant if future acoustic monitoring is limited to seafloor sensors, which do not occupy the predominant habitat of most marine mammals, or sensors that modulate their depth throughout the survey period (e.g., gliders)."

    "text": "Male and female sperm whales are sexually dimorphic and differences in body size (males are larger than females) have been linked to differences in echolocation click characteristics (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022). The Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) is a result of the time taken for the click to reflect multiple times between air sacs at opposite ends of the spermaceti organ and to exit the rostrum in several subsequent pulses (Møhl et al. 2000), and thus the IPI has been found to relate to body size. Similarly, the Inter-Click Interval (ICI), which is the time between pulse trains, can serve as a proxy for sperm whale body size and sex, as males click every ~1s and females click every 0.5s (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022). This pilot study investigated the potential for assessing demographic composition of sperm whales in the California Current using inter-click interval as a proxy for sex/size in acoustic data from six drifting buoys.\n\n\nSperm whale echolocation clicks were detected using the multi-step approach described in (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022) appendix, with manual review of putative sperm whale acoustic encounters using DetEdit. Histograms of ICI provide a visualization to indicate sperm whale size and sex (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022). A plot of concatenated histograms, referred to as ICIgrams, was annotated and categorized for each time period at each site (see Figure 1). Detections with a modal ICI of 600 ms or less were presumed to be females and their young, or Social Groups. Detections with a modal ICI of 0.8 s and greater will be considered Adult Males. The detections with a modal ICI between the Social Groups and Adult Males (&lt; 0.6 s and &gt; 0.8 s) could contain large females or juvenile males, and will be referred to as Mid-Size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example ICIgram GUI for November 9th, 2023 from Adrift-105. Time is represented on the x-axis, interclick interval (ms) on the y-axis, and color represents the histogram count of each value. The white markers represent 5-min size class classification bins. White markers 700 ms and below represent Social Groups.\n\n\n\n\nThe ICIgram method was originally developed for sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022), and has been applied to sperm whales in the Gulf of Alaska (Posdaljian et al. 2023) and in southern New England (Westell et al. 2024). To compare how effectively the ICIgram method can be used to categorize the size/sex of sperm whales in the California Current, length estimates using IPI from individual animals were matched with the size/sex classification using the ICIgram method.\nIPIs were extracted using the Cachalot Automatic Body Length Estimator (CABLE) (Beslin et al. 2018). This tool estimates the body length of sperm whales by compiling and clustering their IPI distributions. To avoid including the same animal more than once, only unique IPI values were retained in the final analysis.\nThe results of this pilot study identified only one size/sex class (Social Groups) based on their echolocation ICI, supported by examining IPI for individual clicks. Sperm whale body length estimates were calculated using both their IPI and ICI for 34 animals encountered across six Adrift study deployments. The animal lengths obtained from the IPI were plotted against the ICI to confirm the linear relationship between the two acoustic characteristics (Figure 2, left). A Thiel-sen regression revealed a slope between ICI and body length suggesting a 1.2 m increase in size associated with a 100 ms increase in ICI (line of best fit: body length = 0.0120*ICI + 2.5, R2 = 0.4, p-value = 0.02: Spearman’s correlation coefficient). No ICIs above 800 ms and total body length above 12.3 m were identified, indicating that only Social Groups with potentially a few subadult males were detected. The Adrift study data suggested a steeper linear relationship between ICI and total length compared to (Solsona-Berga et al. 2022), likely because the Adrift study data only included 34 animals and these were all females and their young with potentially a few subadult males.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Total length calculated using IPI, ICI; time series of animal length estimations across six deployments, and histogram of animal length.

Each point represents a unique animal and the color represents the deployment on which that animal was recorded. Histogram of animal length (m)(right).\n\n\nThis pilot study investigated the potential for assessing demographic composition of sperm whales in the California Current using inter-click interval as a proxy for sex/size in acoustic data from a subset of six drifting recorders. A total of 34 animals with a mean total body length of 10.3 m, likely Social Groups and Mid-Size animals, were identified in the region on November 9th, 2023. By applying this method to the entire dataset, we can further understand the demographics of sperm whales utilizing the California Current and potentially identify regions preferred by different demographic groups (i.e., Social Groups, Mid-Size, and Adult Males). Different demographic groups have differences in behavior and ecology that likely translate to demographic-specific responses to increasing anthropogenic threats and climate change. This type of analysis can play an important role for monitoring future changes to sperm whales in the California Current."

    "text": "The Adrift in the California Current survey was intended to provide additional baseline data on marine mammals and the marine soundscape to inform management of offshore renewable resource development in the California Current. In addition to conducting data collection efforts in and around the Morro Bay, Humboldt, and Oregon WEAs, we also analyzed archived data from previous large scale acoustic surveys.\nThe first phase of Adrift was initiated in June 2020 off Northern California, with a special focus on the Humboldt WEA. We partnered with NOAA Sanctuaries to provide additional sampling off San Francisco between late Spring and late Summer. Initial deployments were delayed until August 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second phase extended this effort to the Morro Bay WEA offshore Central California in 2021. In 2022 we initiated a pilot study to examine the potential for extending this study northward to include offshore Oregon. Data collection efforts were severely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as inclement weather and oceanographic conditions aggravated by La Niña. Despite these limitations, we deployed 90 drifting recorders in our four study areas for a total of 8,736 recording hours.\nPrior to this study, NOAA had successfully deployed drifting acoustic recorders during two large-scale surveys and developed methods to estimate beaked whale density for the larger California Current region. Southwest Fisheries Science Center in partnership with BOEM’s Pacific Region is currently conducting an additional large-scale survey with drifting acoustic recorders (Pacific Marine Assessment Partnership for Protected Species – PacMAPPS II/CalCurCEAS).\nWhile we have been successful using drifting recorders during these large-scale surveys during the late post-upwelling season, we encountered significant challenges in using them during other oceanographic seasons. There were multiple cases of equipment and data loss, especially during the initial deployments. Losses were due to a variety of reasons, including inclement weather, strong currents, and recorder failures. We mitigated these problems through modifying components and altering survey methods. A number of gear modifications were made to improve robustness and to decrease self-noise that interfered with recording quality.\nDrifting acoustic recorders provide a low-cost alternative to traditional PAM systems and they can provide additional geographic and temporal resolution in remote offshore areas. Clustered drifting recorders provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the contributors to the soundscape. Preliminary results suggest that clustered drifting recorders can be used to reduce the possible range of possible source location for sound sources (see Appendix H) and can provide information on the spatial variation in soundscape (see Appendix I). Drifting recorders were deployed in clusters of 4 drifting recorders in Humboldt and Oregon study areas, and in clusters of 8 in the Morro Bay Study area. In some cases, drifting recorders in close proximity to each other followed dramatically different drift trajectories."

This required significant effort to automate development of paired spectrograms and acoustic recordings for the platform. The citizen scientist portion of this project will be delayed until future continuation of the work done during the Adrift study, however, the platform can currently function as an education learning tool.\nThe software tools designed to manipulate acoustic data for input to Zooniverse are available on GitHub.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of Zooniverse “Ocean Voices” site"

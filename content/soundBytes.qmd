Our periodic 'Sound Bytes' blog provides a general audience with insight into the day-to-day work behind the science. Topics range from 'Lessons learned from Fishermen' to how we ‘Gear up for Fieldwork’ to how we ‘Hook young scientists on Research’. We have had a host of guest bloggers, including students, interns, and collaborators. These blogs are shared on NOAA's website and they have been promoted through numerous NOAA newsletters.

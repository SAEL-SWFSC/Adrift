title: Pascal Data
---

PASCAL was a dedicated cetacean acoustic survey in the California Current off the U.S. West Coast in August and September 2016. Background information on this survey as well as preliminary analysis are provided in Keating et al. (2018). A map of drift tracks is provided in @fig-PASCAL_DriftTracks_All.

Data were analyzed following methods consistent with the Adrift data analysis, with slight modifications to address duty cycled data. The power spectral density plots (PSD) can be found [online](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PASCAL_PSD_SeasonRegion.png).

Each of the major odontocete groups were detected during the PASCAL study (@fig-PASCAL_PmBwUdNbhf_HourlyPresence).

Effort is outlined with a black line, and hours of effort with detections are highlighted in red. Daily deployment hours ranged from 24 to over 300 hours per day, depending on the number of acoustic recorders deployed per day. Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. The detection of all odontocete species varied over the timeframe of the survey."}

Blue whale detections were dominated by song, as the low hourly presence of D calls indicates that A/B (song) calls dominated the blue whale detections (@fig-PASCAL_BlueAllBlueDFin20Fin40_HourlyPresence). Likewise, detection of fin whales was dominated by 20 Hz calls (@fig-PASCAL_BlueAllBlueDFin20Fin40_HourlyPresence). There were no calls associated with Bryde's or Gray whales.

Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. The proportion of total hours with blue whale song (A/B calls, or non- D calls) and fin whale song (20 Hz calls) were very high at the end of the survey effort, while blue whale D calls and fin whale 40 Hz calls remained low for the entire survey."}

There were few hourly detections of humpback whales (hourly presence plots can be found in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PASCAL_humpbackSongSocial_HourlyPresence.png). Most of the PASCAL deployments were further offshore than the Adrift deployments, and this offshore distribution may be the reason for such low detection rates.

There were a few calls associated with sei and minke whales. There is little known about the vocal repertoire of sei whales in the Pacific Ocean, although a single encounter with four loud low-frequency downsweeps were detected and considered as 'possible' sei whale vocalizations (see spectrogram in [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PossSei_Pascal010.png). Minke whale boings are seasonal vocalizations and more frequently detected during the winter.

A complete list of successful drifting acoustic recorder deployments during the PASCAL survey are provided in Table Bâ€‘1 . Sites include Washington (WAS), Columbia River (COL), Oregon (ORE), Humboldt (HUM), Mendocino (MND), Point Arena (PTA), Monterey Bay (MBY), Morro Bay (MOB), Channel Islands (CHI), San Diego (SND), and Baja California Norte (BCN).

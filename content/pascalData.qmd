title: PASCAL Data 
---

PASCAL was a dedicated cetacean acoustic survey in the California Current off the U.S. West Coast in August and September 2016. Background information on this survey as well as preliminary analysis are provided in Keating et al. (2018). A map of drift tracks is provided in @fig-PASCAL_DriftTracks_All.

## *Deployment Map*

Drifts are shown as black/white lines; Wind Energy Areas are outlined in purple, and shipping lanes for entry to San Francisco Bay and in Southern California Bight are outlined in yellow](/figs/PASCAL_DriftTracks_All.png){#fig-PASCAL_DriftTracks_All fig-alt="Map of the west coast of the United States with plots of all successful PASCAL drifts shown as black and white lines that represent their geoposition during the drift. The west coast Wind Energy Areas are outlined in purple, and shipping traffic lanes are outlined in yellow. Latitude is on the x-axis, and Longitude is on the y-axis. Bathymetry is shown with light blue for the shelf and slope waters, and dark blue for deep ocean waters. A 100 m and 200 m isobath line is provided." width="432"}

Data were analyzed following methods consistent with the Adrift data analysis, with slight modifications to address duty cycled data. The power spectral density plots (PSD) can be found [online](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PASCAL_PSD_SeasonRegion.png).

## *Odontocete Detections*
Each of the major odontocete groups were detected during the PASCAL study (@fig-PASCAL_PmBwUdNbhf_HourlyPresence).

The number of hours for combined deployments is provided on the y-axis, and the date on the x-axis, with seasons shaded in blue for winter, green for upwelling, and yellow for the post-upwelling season (all effort for PASCAL was during the post-upwelling season). Effort is outlined with a black line, and hours of effort with detections are highlighted in red. Daily deployment hours ranged from 24 to over 300 hours per day, depending on the number of acoustic recorders deployed per day. Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. The detection of all odontocete species varied over the timeframe of the survey." width="535"}

## *Mysticete Detections*
Blue whale detections were dominated by song, as the low hourly presence of D calls indicates that A/B (song) calls dominated the blue whale detections (@fig-PASCAL_BlueAllBlueDFin20Fin40_HourlyPresence). Likewise, detection of fin whales was dominated by 20 Hz calls (@fig-PASCAL_BlueAllBlueDFin20Fin40_HourlyPresence). There were no calls associated with Bryde's or Gray whales.

Daily deployment hours ranged from 24 to over 300 hours per day, depending on the number of acoustic recorders deployed per day. Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. The proportion of total hours with blue whale song (A/B calls, or non- D calls) and fin whale song (20 Hz calls) were very high at the end of the survey effort, while blue whale D calls and fin whale 40 Hz calls remained low for the entire survey." width="535"}

There were few hourly detections of humpback whales (hourly presence plots can be found in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PASCAL_humpbackSongSocial_HourlyPresence.png). Most of the PASCAL deployments were further offshore than the Adrift deployments, and this offshore distribution may be the reason for such low detection rates.

There were a few calls associated with sei and minke whales. There is little known about the vocal repertoire of sei whales in the Pacific Ocean, although a single encounter with four loud low-frequency downsweeps were detected and considered as 'possible' sei whale vocalizations (see spectrogram in [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/PossSei_Pascal010.png). Minke whale boings are seasonal vocalizations and more frequently detected during the winter.

## *Acoustic Scenes by Drift*
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Temporal variation (marked in hourly bins) in the contribution of these sounds to the overall soundscape are provided by the acoustic scene. An acoustic scene provides a visualization of the spectral variation in the contributors to the soundscape, where detection of various species classes is noted by the approximate frequency of their sounds (see @CCES_007_AcousticScene). Acoustic Scenes were created for each CCES drift, and high resolution images are saved in the Github Repository\](), and links to specific drifts are provided in the table, right.

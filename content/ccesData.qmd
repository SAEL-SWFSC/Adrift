title: CCES Data 
---

CCES was a multidisciplinary survey of the marine ecosystem from the US-Canada border south to Northern Baja California, Mexico. Background information on this survey as well as preliminary analysis of beaked whale, sperm whale, and narrow band high frequency species are provided in (Simonis 2020). A map of tracklines is provided in @fig-CCES_DriftTracks_All.

## *Deployment Map*
![Plot of all successful drifts deployed during the CCES Survey. Drifts are shown as black/white lines; Wind Energy Areas are outlined in purple, and shipping lanes for entry to San Francisco Bay are outlined in yellow.](/figs/CCES_DriftTracks_All.png){#fig-CCES_DriftTracks_All fig-alt="Map of the west coast of the United States with plots of all successful CCES drifts shown as black and white lines that represent their geoposition during the drift. The west coast Wind Energy Areas are outlined in purple, and shipping traffic lanes are outlined in yellow. Latitude is on the x-axis, and Longitude is on the y-axis. Bathymetry is shown with light blue for the shelf and slope waters, and dark blue for deep ocean waters. A 100 m and 200 m isobath line is provided.\"" width="497"}

Data were analyzed following methods consistent with the Adrift data analysis, with slight modifications to address duty cycled data. The power spectral density plots (PSD) can be found [online](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/CCES_PSD_SeasonRegion.png).

## *Odontocete Detections*
Each of the major odontocete groups were detected during the CCES study (@fig-CCES_PmBwUdNbhf_HourlyPresence).

The number of hours for combined deployments is provided on the y-axis, and the date on the x-axis, with seasons shaded in blue for winter, green for upwelling, and yellow for the post-upwelling season (all effort for CCES was during the post-upwelling season). Effort is outlined with a black line, and hours of effort with detections are highlighted in red. Daily deployment hours ranged from 24 to 160 hours per day, depending on the number of acoustic recorders deployed per day. Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. Hourly detection of beaked whales and dolphins increased later in the survey. Detection of sperm whales was low except for two peaks (likely related to specific drifts), and detection of NBHF was low throughout the survey." width="535"}

## *Mysticete Detections*
Blue whale detections were dominated by song, as the low hourly presence of D calls indicates that A/B (song) calls dominated the blue whale detections (@fig-CCES_BlueAllBlueDFin20minke_HourlyPresence). There were a few minke whale detections in the later months of the survey. Detection of fin whales was dominated by 20 Hz calls (@fig-CCES_BlueAllBlueDFin20minke_HourlyPresence). There were no Fin whale 40 Hz calls, or calls associated with Bryde's, sei, or gray whales.

Effort is outlined with a black line, and hours of effort with detections are highlighted in red. Daily deployment hours ranged from 24 to over 160 hours per day, depending on the number of acoustic recorders deployed per day. Detection of all species varied based on the number and location of acoustic recorders deployed on that date. The proportion of total hours with blue whale song (A/B calls, or non- D calls) were very high at the end of the survey effort, while blue whale D calls low for the entire survey. The proportion of total hours with fin whale song (20 Hz) were lower at the end of the survey effort and there were no detections of fin whale 40 Hz calls during the CCES survey. There were few detections of minke whale boing calls later in the survey." width="535"}

There were few hourly detections of humpback whales (hourly presence plots can be found in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SAEL-SWFSC/Adrift/blob/main/figs/CCES_humpbackSongSocial_HourlyPresence.png). Most of the CCES deployments were further offshore than the Adrift deployments, and this offshore distribution may be the reason for such low detection rates.

## *Acoustic Scenes by Drift*
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Temporal variation (marked in hourly bins) in the contribution of these sounds to the overall soundscape are provided by the acoustic scene. An acoustic scene provides a visualization of the spectral variation in the contributors to the soundscape, where detection of various species classes is noted by the approximate frequency of their sounds (see @fig-CCES_007_AcousticScene). Acoustic Scenes were created for each CCES drift, and high resolution images are saved in the Github Repository\](), and links to specific drifts are provided in the table, right.

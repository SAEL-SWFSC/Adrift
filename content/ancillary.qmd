title: Ancillary Projects 
---

In addition to the primary goals outlined in our project Objectives, there were several ancillary projects designed to investigate potential for expanded studies. All ancillary projects are considered 'pilot' projects, and summaries of these projects include:

-   [Sperm Whale Demographics](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/content/spermDemographics.html)

-   [NBHF Acoustic Classification](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/content/nbhfClassification.html)

-   [Fin Whale AI Models](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/content/finAI.html)

-   [Modeling Habitat Use with Clustered Recorders](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/content/habitatModels.html)

-   [Assessing Spatial Variation in Noise with Clustered Recorders](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/Adrift/content/spatialNoise.html)
